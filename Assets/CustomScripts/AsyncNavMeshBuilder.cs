/*
 * Notes on dynamic NavMesh construction
 * -------------------------------------
 * - A NavMesh must be built before any NavMeshAgent can be instantiated.
 *   If NavMeshAgents are present in the scene hierarchy, this NavMesh builder
 *   must be run first (Init()) with some initial meshes. Its parent object can
 *   be forced to start up before other objects using the DefaultExecutionOrder
 *   attribute.
 * - UpdateNavMesh() builds and updates the NavMesh and can be run in blocking
 *   or asynchronous mode. The latter is for dynamically building the mesh and
 *   the former is only used for initial NavMesh construction.
 * - It is possible to use the AsyncOperation token in a coroutine's yield
 *   statement, which causes the coroutine to resume only when the operation
 *   completes. Alternatively, isDone can be polled in an Update() method.
 * - Although the documentation says that empty bounds in UpdateNavMeshData() 
 *   calls will consider all meshes passed in, this is in fact not true. An 
 *   artificially large bounding box is created to ensure everything is 
 *   processed.
 * 
 * Some things I am still unclear about:
 * 
 * - Settings for different agent types. NavMesh.GetSettingsByID() gets the
 *   settings configured in the Navigation window (although these can be set
 *   programmatically, also). To find settings for a given agent type, need to
 *   loop through all the IDs and check the string name to build a map of
 *   string -> integer ID. I *think* settings are part of the hash for 
 *   UpdateNavMeshData(), so perhaps this needs to be called multiple times for
 *   different agent types?
