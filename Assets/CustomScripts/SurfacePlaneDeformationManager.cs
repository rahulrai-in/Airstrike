/*
 * Singleton component for embedding small, non-collidable objects into 
 * SurfacePlane regions.
 * 
 * Requirements for embeddable objects
 * -----------------------------------
 * - Pivot point of the object is assumed to be flush with the surface in which
 *   it is being embedded. That is, when placing the object, its transform 
 *   position should be set to a point on the surface.
 * - There are no requirements on the orientation of the object itself. Rather,
 *   an OrientedBoundingBox must be supplied in world space units with the z
 *   (forward) axis oriented normal to the surface, even if the object's z axis
 *   is *not* oriented this way. The z axis length defines the thickness of the
 *   object, which is also the required spatial mesh margin (discussed further
 *   below) that will be created.
 * - No instanced materials. Objects should use only the shared materials they
 *   are instantiated with in the first place.
 * - SharedMaterialHelper must be attached to the object (unless temporary 
 *   high priority rendering is disabled)
 * 
 * The problem with embedding small objects
 * ----------------------------------------
 * When used for occlusion, the spatial mesh is rendered to the depth buffer
 * and has a *higher* render priority (i.e., lower render queue value) than
 * ordinary geometry. As of this writing, the HoloToolkit sets the spatial mesh
 * render queue value to 1999, where the normal geometry render queue value is
 * 2000.
 * 
 * Therefore, embedding a small object in the wall is impossible because it
 * will be occluded by the spatial mesh. Creating large holes by modifying the
 * spatial mesh (as in Microsoft's examples) is a simpler problem: triangles
 * are simply removed from the mesh within some radius or volume. The natural
 * "noisiness" of the surface mesh triangles creates the desired jagged
 * boundary. Small objects, like bullet holes, on the other hand, may be
 * smaller than a single surface mesh triangle. Attempting to create "small"
 * holes in the spatial mesh using complex computational solid geometry
 * technique is overkill.
 * 
 * One simple solution is to modify the render priority of the embedded object
 * so that it is drawn *before* the spatial mesh. Unfortunately, this means the
 * embedded objects will never be occluded at all, not even by walls and
 * objects that legitimately obscure the embedded object. For example,
 * consider a small bullet hole in a wall and then a (real) pillar in front of
 * the wall. The spatial mesh corresponding to the pillar *should* obscure the
 * hole but with this scheme, will not because the occlusion shader does not
 * render to the color buffer and the spatial mesh is rendered *after* the
 * hole.
 * 
 * How SurfacePlaneDeformationManager works
 * ----------------------------------------
 * A simple, effective way to embed small objects into surfaces is to displace
 * the surface mesh behind the embedded object by a margin equal to the
 * thickness of the object. The collider mesh is *not* updated, so collisions
 * with the surface are unaffected.
 * 
 * The procedure used here is:
 * 
 *  1. Make embedded object render priority *higher* than spatial meshes by
 *     assigning lower render queue values to its instanced materials. This
 *     feature is configurable via a paramter.
 *  2. Compute object thickness. This is the required margin necessary to
 *     "push back" spatial mesh triangles by, so that none overlap with the
 *     embedded object.
 *  3. Encode the margin volume as points on the front and back sides (along
 *     the axis pointing into the surface). The difference between these two
 *     points is the object "thickness"  plus an optional extra displacement.
 *     The width and height of the deformation volume are equal to the surface
 *     plane into which the object is being embedded. This will cause the
 *     entire surface plane volume to be adjusted at once allowing subsequent
 *     objects to be embedded readily.
 *  4. For each spatial mesh, check whether it has already been deformed and
 *     whether the margin is sufficient to accomodate placing the new embedded
 *     object. If so, no need to process this mesh.
 *  5. Otherwise, find the triangles that intersect with the margin volume's
 *     OBB.
 *  6. Project each of the intersecting triangles' vertices onto the back plane
 *     of the margin volume ("push" them back) and then update the spatial mesh
 *     vertices without updating the collider mesh.
 *  7. Record the margin for this spatial mesh. Note that both the spatial mesh
 *     *and* the SurfacePlane are required because a single spatial mesh may 
 *     contain multiple SurfacePlanes. The margin created through deformation
 *     only exists in the vicinity of a given plane.
 *  8. Restore the shared materials of the embedded object (which will also 
 *     restore its original render queue values).
 *     
 * Note that steps 4 through 8 are performed in a coroutine over multiple
 * frames.
 * 
 * Arbitrary spatial mesh
 * ----------------------
 * An alternative form of Embed() is provided that does not require a 
 * SurfacePlane. This version works virtually identically except that it
 * deforms only the portion of the spatial meshes that is intersected by
 * the embedded object. Consequently, the meshes have to be searched and
 * deformed each time.
